# Quizzical
A fun quiz

## Demo

The project is hosted on Netlify, you can check: https://quizzical-fun-quiz.netlify.app/

## Project description

This is a general knowledge quiz with 5 questions. The quiz starts with a starting page. After entering the quiz, for each question you get 4 answers or true/false answers, you can pick only one answer. Then you can check answers, see your mistakes, get your score and start again with another quiz. 

The quiz is built on ReactJS and Typescript, using useContext, useEffect, useReducer, React router, nanoid. Questions are fetched from a third party API: Open Trivia Database https://opentdb.com/. The aim of the project was to learn and practice these technologies.
